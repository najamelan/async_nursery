//! With an executor from async_executors you can use the timeout method to limit the life
//! time of spawned tasks. Tasks that time out are dropped and no result is sent to the
//! output stream.
//!
//! Expected output in 3 seconds:
//!
//! $ cargo run --example resource_await
//!
//! INFO timeout: nursery created
//! INFO timeout: spawned slow 0
//! INFO timeout: spawned slow 3
//! INFO timeout: spawned slow 4
//! INFO timeout: spawned slow 1
//! INFO timeout: spawned slow 2
//! INFO timeout: completed slow 0
//! INFO timeout: completed slow 1
//! INFO timeout: completed slow 2
//! INFO timeout: drop Nursery and NurseryStream
